1. Install Anaconda Python distribution software
	If you have your own computer download it here (should be Python 3.9):
	https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

	If you use the computers at Chalmers you dont need to do anything since Anaconda already exists.


2. Go to the start menu in Windows and write "Anaconda Prompt" and click the app icon with this name.


3. A terminal window appears. Now we will create a python environment for use with Optoprop:
	a) Write the following command in the window:

		conda create -n optopropEnv python numpy scipy matplotlib spyder shapely pandas

	   Press y to continue when asked. This step may take some time. This command has now 
	   created the environment optopropEnv and it already includes a number of the packages 
	   required for it to work.


	b) When the previous step is finished write the following command:

		conda activate optopropEnv


	c) Write the command below to install an additional package for creating CAD surfaces:

		conda install -c conda-forge numpy-stl


	d) Write the command below to install an additional package for visualizing the propeller and an old excel package:

		pip install vtkplotlib
		pip install openpyxl


4. Start spyder by searching for it in the start menu. This program is for coding and running Python code. 
   Similar to Matlab. Open the (optopropEnv)
	a) First go into Tools > Preferences > IPython console > Graphics > Graphics backend. Change from
	   "inline" to "automatic". Press OK.


	b) Go to File > Open and find the fine OPTOPROP.py. This file is now open in the editor and can be 
	   run by pressing F5. The input data used for design in found in the file "inputFile_course.py".
